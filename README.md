# A simulation-based approach to teach biostatistics in health sciences
Despite the increasing relevance of statistics in health sciences, teaching styles in higher education are remarkably similar across disciplines: lectures covering the theory and methods, followed by application and computer exercises in given data sets. This often leads to challenges for students in comprehending fundamental statistical concepts essential for medical research. What ca we do about it? We propose to use simulations to teach statistics :chart_with_downwards_trend: in a medical context :hospital:. We describe our thought-process and many examples in three peer-reviewed papers: [Paper 1](https://mededu.jmir.org/2024/1/e52679/), [Paper II](https://doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2024.2394536), and [Paper III](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09332480.2024.2348972).

## The Potential of Simulations in Public Health :teacher:
Let's start with an introduction to simulations in public health and epidemiology. In this [paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09332480.2024.2348972), we collected our thoughts from multiple discussions about the importance of appreciating and embracing statistical thinking in public health research and education. We think that statistical simulations can play an important role in fostering statistical reasoning in public health and that they can be a great didactic tool for students to generate and learn from data. Two main points are of relevance here. First, simulations can foster critical thinking and improve our reasoning about public health problems by going from theoretical thoughts to practical implementation of designing a computer experiment. Second, simulations can support researchers and their students to better understand statistical concepts used when describing and analysing population health in terms of distributions. Overall, we advocate for the use of more simulations in public health research and education to strengthen statistical reasoning when studying the health of populations.

## DICE (Design, Interpret, Compute, Experiment) :game_die:
How can we teach statistics in health sciences? We propose a teaching and learning method that we call DICE (Design, Interpret, Compute, Experiment). That's how it works: Students will work in small groups to plan, generate, analyze, interpret, and communicate their own scientific investigation with simulations. With a focus on fundamental statistical concepts such as sampling variability, error probabilities, and the construction of statistical models, DICE offers a promising approach to learning how to combine substantive medical knowledge and statistical concepts. These are the steps involved in the group activity:

## Simulations to teach interaction effects :green_circle::yellow_circle:
How do we know that it works? We evaluated the approach in a 3-hour long workshop on teaching interaction effects to graduate students. In this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2024.2394536), we describe the steps involved in organizing and implementing a simulation-based activity and present the results and evaluation from our workshop. Additionally, the article contains materials for students and teachers to get started with simulations and interaction effects.
