# A simulation-based approach to teach biostatistics in health sciences
This repo contains papers, ideas, and computer code to use simulations to teach biostatistics and epidemiology in a medical context.

# DICE (Design, Interpret, Compute, Experiment) :game_die:
Despite the increasing relevance of statistics in health sciences, teaching styles in higher education are remarkably similar across disciplines: lectures covering the theory and methods, followed by application and computer exercises in given data sets. This often leads to challenges for students in comprehending fundamental statistical concepts essential for medical research. To address these challenges, we propose an engaging learning approach—DICE (design, interpret, compute, estimate)—aimed at enhancing the learning experience of statistics in public health and epidemiology. In introducing DICE, we guide readers through a practical example. Students will work in small groups to plan, generate, analyze, interpret, and communicate their own scientific investigation with simulations. With a focus on fundamental statistical concepts such as sampling variability, error probabilities, and the construction of statistical models, DICE offers a promising approach to learning how to combine substantive medical knowledge and statistical concepts. The materials in this paper, including the computer code, can be readily used as a hands-on tool for both teachers and students.

# Simulations to teach interaction effects :green_circle::yellow_circle:
Simulation-based teaching can be a valuable method for learning statistical concepts. Its practical implementation for health-related subjects is seldomly evaluated. We propose a simulation-based approach to teach interaction effects in a postgraduate biostatistics course. To evaluate the approach, in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2024.2394536), we describe the steps involved in organizing and implementing a simulation-based activity and evaluate its execution. The article contains materials for students and teachers to get started with simulations and interaction effects.
