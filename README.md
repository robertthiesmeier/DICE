# DICE (Design, Interpret, Compute, Experiment)
## An interactvity tool to teach and statistics in epidemiological research

The aim of the DICE activity is to apply statistical reasoning to all stages of planning and designing a study. There are no limits to creativity. You can either replicate existing studies from the literature or think about studies that you would like to conduct. Be as realistic as possible and think about the details of the study. The focus lies be on the conceptual thinking and trying to deeply appreciate the contribution of statistical reasoning.

## DICE and simulations
DICE is grounded in the idea of Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) and their use for illustrating important epidemiological and statistical concepts. MCS allows us to study a phenomena or concept with randomly generated data. One example is to simulate a real investigation. Using simulations to generate our own data, we can assess the impact of how we design and analyse studies in public health. Not only is this a great way of learning how to design studies, but it also helps us to observe difficulties and scenarios that might occur if we had conducted the study.

Making use of simulations can facilitate thoughts beyond being purely theoretical, mathematical statistics. It teaches us to use our creativity to get distribution of results and can give meaning to how we derive, analyse, and interpret these findings. As such, our reasoning becomes more structured and goes beyond the use of common thought experiments. Simulations can help us to learn and understand the theoretical concepts of statistical models and fundamental statistical concepts.
